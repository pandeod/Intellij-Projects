Welcome to the second episode of the SDS Podcast, which is all about Machine Learning. Here we go!
Today's guest is Hadelin de Ponteves, Machine Learning Expert and Entrepreneur.

In fact, it's grown so quickly over the past decade that now you are almost expected to know some level of Machine Learning to call yourself a Data Scientist.
