Software has pervaded our society, from modern
households to spacecrafts. It has become an essential
component of any electronic device or system.
This is why software development has turned out to
be an exciting career for computer engineers in the
last 10–15 years. However, software development
faces many challenges. Software is becoming complex,
but the demand for quality in software products
has increased. This rise in customer awareness
for quality increases the workload and responsibility
of the software development team. That is why
software testing has gained so much popularity in
the last decade. Job trends have shifted from development
to software testing. Today, software quality
assurance and software testing courses are offered
by many institutions. Organizations have separate testing groups with proper
hierarchy. Software development is driven with testing outputs. If the testing
team claims the presence of bugs in the software, then the development team
cannot release the product.
However, there still is a gap between academia and the demand of industries.
The practical demand is that passing graduates must be aware of testing
terminologies, standards, and techniques. But students are not aware in most
cases, as our universities and colleges do not offer separate software quality
and testing courses. They study only software engineering. It can be said that
software engineering is a mature discipline today in industry as well as in
academia. On the other hand, software testing is mature in industry but not in
academia. Thus, this gap must be bridged with separate courses on software
quality and testing so that students do not face problems when they go for
testing in industries. Today, the ideas and techniques of software testing have
become essential knowledge for software developers, testers, and students as
well. This book is a step forward to bridge this gap.
